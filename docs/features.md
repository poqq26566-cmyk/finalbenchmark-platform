- **D**: Below 70%
- **F**: Bottom 10%

Throttle Test Scoring (lines in artifact):

Formula: (Performance Retention × 0.5) + (Time to Throttle × 0.3) + (Thermal Efficiency × 0.2)
Score range: 0-10,000 points
Grades based on throttling percentage
Tracks: Initial performance, sustained performance, temperature, time to throttle


Efficiency Test Scoring (lines in artifact):

Formula: (Performance Output / Power Consumption) × 1000
Score range: 0-15,000 points
Grades: A+ (>12,000) to F (<2,000)
Tracks: Performance per watt, battery drain rate, temperature
