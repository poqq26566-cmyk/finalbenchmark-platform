## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of CPU Benchmarking

## 2. Test List

The CPU tests are divided into two main categories: Single-Core Performance Tests and Multi-Core Performance Tests. This division allows for comprehensive evaluation of both per-core performance and multi-threading efficiency.

### Single-Core Performance Tests

These tests are designed to measure the performance of individual CPU cores, focusing on per-core capabilities without the influence of multi-threading:

### Single-Core Test 1: Prime Number Generation

**Algorithm Used**: Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. The algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number as composite, starting from 2. It begins by marking all multiples of 2 (except 2 itself), then moves to the next unmarked number (3) and marks its multiples, and continues this process until all numbers up to the limit have been processed.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(n log log n)
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log log n) where n is the upper limit of the range. This is because for each prime number p, the algorithm marks approximately n/p multiples. The sum of reciprocals of primes up to n is approximately log log n, leading to the overall complexity. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the boolean array that tracks which numbers are prime.

**Dataset/Workload Details**: 
- Range: Calculate all primes up to 10 million (10,000,000)
- Memory allocation: Boolean array of size 10,000,000
- Iterations: Up to √n iterations where n = 10,000,000
- Threading model: Can be parallelized using segmented sieve approach for multi-core systems

**Measurements Captured**:
- Total execution time from start to completion
- Operations per second (sieve operations)
- Memory access patterns and cache efficiency
- Correctness validation through prime count verification
- Memory bandwidth utilization during array operations

**Hardware Behavior Targeted**:
- Memory subsystem performance (cache hits/misses, memory bandwidth)
- Integer arithmetic units and ALU utilization
- Memory access pattern efficiency
- Branch prediction for conditional marking operations

**Notes on Deterministic Behavior**: The algorithm is completely deterministic and produces the same results regardless of execution environment. The performance differences arise from hardware capabilities rather than algorithmic variations.

### Single-Core Test 2: Fibonacci Sequence (Recursive)

**Algorithm Used**: Recursive Fibonacci Implementation
The recursive Fibonacci algorithm calculates Fibonacci numbers using the classic recursive definition: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with base cases F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. This implementation has exponential time complexity due to redundant calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times. Each call to F(n) results in two additional calls, creating a binary tree of function calls.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(2^n)
The time complexity is exponential, specifically O(2^n), because each call to fibonacci(n) results in two more calls: fibonacci(n-1) and fibonacci(n-2). This creates a binary tree of function calls with approximately 2^n nodes. The space complexity is O(n) due to the maximum recursion depth of the call stack.

**Dataset/Workload Details**:
- Input range: Calculate fibonacci(n) for n = 35 to 45
- Recursive depth: Up to n levels of function calls
- Function call overhead: Each recursive call adds overhead to the stack

**Measurements Captured**:
- Total execution time for each Fibonacci calculation

**Hardware Behavior Targeted**:

**Notes on Deterministic Behavior**: The algorithm produces identical results but with exponential performance degradation as input size increases, making it ideal for measuring CPU performance differences.

### Single-Core Test 3: Matrix Multiplication

**Algorithm Used**: Standard Triple-Nested Loop Matrix Multiplication
The algorithm implements the standard matrix multiplication formula C = A × B where each element c[i][j] is calculated as the dot product of row i from matrix A and column j from matrix B. The implementation uses three nested loops to iterate through the rows of A, columns of B, and the inner dimension to compute the dot products.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(n³) for n×n matrices
For square matrices of size n×n, the algorithm performs n³ multiplications and additions. With three nested loops each running n times, the time complexity is O(n³). The space complexity is O(n²) for storing the three matrices (input A, input B, and result C).

**Dataset/Workload Details**:

The test implements cryptographic hash functions SHA-256 and MD5 to process large data blocks. SHA-256 processes data in 512-bit chunks using a series of logical functions and modular arithmetic operations. MD5 processes data in 512-bit blocks through four rounds of operations involving bitwise functions, modular addition, and left rotations.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(n) where n is the input data size
Both SHA-256 and MD5 have linear time complexity relative to the input size. Each block of data requires a fixed number of operations regardless of content. The space complexity is O(1) as only a fixed amount of state data is maintained throughout the process.

**Dataset/Workload Details**:
- Data size: 100 MB of random data for hashing
- Block processing: 512-bit blocks for both algorithms

**Notes on Deterministic Behavior**: Hash functions are deterministic by design, producing identical outputs for identical inputs across all platforms.

### Single-Core Test 5: String Sorting

**Algorithm Used**: Hybrid Sorting Algorithm (Introsort - Introspective Sort)
The implementation uses Introsort, which begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a certain threshold to guarantee O(n log n) worst-case performance. For small arrays, it may use insertion sort for optimization. The algorithm partitions the array around a pivot element and recursively sorts the partitions.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(n log n) average and O(n log n) worst case
Introsort maintains O(n log n) average performance like quicksort but guarantees O(n log n) worst-case performance by switching to heapsort when necessary. The space complexity is O(log n) for the recursion stack in average cases.

### Single-Core Test 6: Ray Tracing

**Algorithm Used**: Basic Ray Tracing with Recursive Reflection
The algorithm implements a simplified ray tracer that calculates the color of each pixel by casting rays from a virtual camera through the image plane into a 3D scene. For each ray, it determines which object it intersects first, calculates lighting using Phong reflection model, and optionally traces reflected rays for mirror-like surfaces. The implementation includes sphere objects and basic lighting calculations.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(w×h×r) where w=width, h=height, r=recursion depth
For an image of width w and height h with maximum recursion depth r, the complexity depends on the number of rays cast (w×h) and the average number of objects tested per ray. The space complexity is O(r) for the recursion stack depth.

The implementation uses an LZ77-style compression algorithm that maintains a sliding window of previously seen data and encodes new data as references to previous occurrences. The algorithm searches for the longest match between the current input and the sliding window, encoding matches as (offset, length) pairs and literal characters when no matches are found.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(n×m) average where n is input size and m is the average search window size
In the worst case, when searching the entire window for each input character, the complexity becomes O(n²). The space complexity is O(w) where w is the window size, typically a few hundred KB.

The algorithm implements a classic Monte Carlo simulation to estimate π by randomly sampling points in a unit square and determining the ratio of points that fall inside a unit circle. For each random point (x,y), it calculates x² + y² and compares to 1 to determine if the point is inside the circle. The ratio of points inside the circle to total points approximates π/4.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(n) where n is the number of random samples

### Single-Core Test 9: JSON Parsing

**Algorithm Used**: Recursive Descent JSON Parser
The parser implements a recursive descent algorithm that processes JSON tokens according to the JSON grammar. It recognizes JSON values (objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null) and recursively parses nested structures. The parser maintains state for current position, handles string escaping, number formatting, and validates JSON syntax throughout the parsing process.

**Algorithm Used**: Backtracking Algorithm with Constraint Propagation
The algorithm implements a backtracking solution to the N-Queens problem, which places N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The algorithm places queens row by row, checking for conflicts with previously placed queens in columns and diagonals. When a conflict is detected, it backtracks to try alternative positions.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(N!) worst case, but typically much less due to pruning
In the worst case, the algorithm might explore all possible arrangements, but constraint checking significantly prunes the search space. The space complexity is O(N) for storing the board state and recursion stack.

### Multi-Core Test 10: Parallel N-Queens Problem

**Algorithm Used**: Parallel Backtracking with Search Space Division
The algorithm divides the initial search space among multiple threads, with each thread exploring a different portion of the solution space. Advanced implementations may use techniques like work-stealing to balance the load when some threads finish their assigned portion earlier than others.

**Complexity Analysis**: O(N!) worst case, but typically much less due to pruning, with parallel speedup potential
The algorithm complexity remains the same but can achieve speedup by exploring different branches of the search tree in parallel. The space complexity is O(N) per thread for local board state.

**Dataset/Workload Details**:
- Board size: 16×16 (N=16) for multi-core computational challenge
- Solution search: Distributed search space exploration across threads
- Constraint checking: Parallel column, row, and diagonal conflict detection

- CPU cache efficiency for parallel constraint checking
- Thread scheduling efficiency with irregular workloads

**Notes on Deterministic Behavior**: Finds the same solutions as single-core implementation with improved performance through parallel search space exploration.

## 3. Scaling & Load Adjustment

### Rules for Adapting Workload to Device Tier

The benchmark automatically adjusts workload parameters based on device performance tier to ensure meaningful results across all device classes:

**Slow Tier Devices** (entry-level smartphones, budget tablets):
- Prime number generation: Reduce range to 1 million (1,000,000)

### Threading Model

The benchmark implements three distinct threading approaches to comprehensively test CPU capabilities:

**Single-Core Test**:
- All tests run on a single thread to measure peak single-core performance
- Uses the main application thread or a dedicated single thread
- Focuses on per-core performance metrics
- Essential for understanding peak computational capability per core

**Multi-Core Test**:
- Distributes workload across multiple cores using thread pools
- Typically uses number of physical cores as thread count
- Measures effective multi-core utilization
- Evaluates synchronization overhead and inter-core communication

**Saturation Test**:
- Creates more threads than available cores to test scheduler efficiency
- Uses thread count of 2× physical cores or higher
- Measures system's ability to handle thread contention
- Evaluates thermal and power management under sustained load

### Dynamic Warm-up Rules

To ensure accurate measurements and account for system optimizations:

**JIT Compilation Warm-up**:
- Execute each test algorithm multiple times (5-10 iterations) before timing begins
- Allow Just-In-Time compiler to optimize frequently used code paths
- Monitor performance stabilization before starting timed measurements
- Perform 3 warm-up iterations specifically for JIT optimization

**CPU Governor Adjustment**:
- Temporarily set CPU governor to "performance" mode during benchmark
- Monitor and log any governor changes during testing
- Restore original settings after benchmark completion
- Validate that frequency scaling does not affect results

**Cache Warming**:
- Pre-load test data into CPU caches before performance measurement
- Execute preliminary operations to populate instruction and data caches
- Account for cache miss penalties in performance calculations
- Measure both cold and warm cache performance where applicable

### Iteration Count for Each Benchmark

Each benchmark test is executed 3 times for statistical validity, and the results are averaged to produce the final score. The best practice for benchmarking suggests that multiple runs help account for system noise, thermal throttling, and other variables that might affect performance measurements. The median result is used for scoring to reduce the impact of outliers.

**Single-Core Tests**:
- Each test runs 3 times with warm-up iterations before timing
- Results are averaged after removing outliers (values >15% deviation from median)
- Minimum run time of 1 second per iteration to ensure measurement accuracy

**Multi-Core Tests**:
- Each test runs 3 times with warm-up iterations before timing
- Results are averaged after removing outliers (values >15% deviation from median)
- Minimum run time of 2 seconds per iteration to account for thread synchronization overhead

## 4. Performance Metrics

### Execution Time

Execution time is the primary metric for all CPU benchmark tests, measured from the start of the actual computation to completion. The system captures:

- **Wall-clock time**: Total elapsed time from start to finish
- **CPU time**: Actual processor time consumed by the benchmark process
- **Clock cycles**: Processor cycles consumed (where hardware counters available)
- **Jitter measurements**: Variations in execution time across multiple runs

### Throughput (Operations per Second)

Throughput metrics measure the computational rate achieved by the device:

- **Basic operations per second**: Simple arithmetic operations executed
- **Complex operations per second**: Algorithm-specific operations (e.g., comparisons for sorting)
- **Memory operations per second**: Memory reads/writes for memory-bound algorithms
- **Floating-point operations per second (FLOPS)**: For floating-point intensive tests

### Correctness Check / Checksum Validation

To ensure results are meaningful and not due to errors or cheating:

- **Result verification**: Validate algorithm outputs against known correct values
- **Checksum validation**: Calculate checksums of final results for integrity checking
- **Statistical validation**: Verify Monte Carlo results converge to expected values
- **Cross-validation**: Compare results between different implementations where possible

### Multi-thread Scaling Efficiency (%)

For multi-threaded tests, efficiency is calculated as:

```
Scaling Efficiency % = (Multi-thread Performance / Single-thread Performance) / Number of Threads × 100
```

- **Perfect scaling**: 10% efficiency indicates linear scaling
- **Sub-linear scaling**: Below 100% due to synchronization overhead
- **Super-linear scaling**: Above 100% due to cache effects (rare)

## 5. Scoring Conversion

### Formula for Converting Raw Performance to Normalized Score

The CPU benchmark implements a weighted scoring system that combines single-core and multi-core performance metrics:

**Individual Test Score Calculation:**
```
Individual Test Score = Operations Per Second / 1,000
```

**Weighted Aggregation Formula:**
```
Weighted Score = (Single-Core Score × 0.35) + (Multi-Core Score × 0.65)
```

Where:
- Single-Core Score is the sum of all individual single-core test scores
- Multi-Core Score is the sum of all individual multi-core test scores
- 35% weight is given to single-core performance
- 65% weight is given to multi-core performance

**Normalization Formula:**
```
Final CPU Score = (Weighted Score / Number of Tests) × 100 × Normalization Factor
```

The normalization factor (0.00178) scales the score to the target range (~10,000 for modern CPUs).

### Scoring System Implementation Details

Each benchmark test contributes to the final score with different normalization factors based on the scale of operations per second:

**Single-Core Test Normalization:**
- Prime Generation: ops/sec ÷ 100,000,000
- Fibonacci Recursive: ops/sec × 0.5
- Matrix Multiplication: ops/sec ÷ 100,000,000
- Hash Computing: throughput ÷ 1,000,000 (converts to MB/s)
- String Sorting: ops/sec ÷ 100,000
- Ray Tracing: rays/sec ÷ 10,000,000
- Compression: throughput ÷ 100,000,000
- Monte Carlo π: samples/sec ÷ 100,000,000
- JSON Parsing: elements/sec ÷ 100,000,000
- N-Queens: solutions/sec × 0.5

**Multi-Core Test Normalization:**
- Prime Generation: ops/sec ÷ 100,000
- Fibonacci Memoized: ops/sec × 0.1
- Matrix Multiplication: ops/sec ÷ 10,000
- Hash Computing: throughput ÷ 1,000,000
- String Sorting: ops/sec ÷ 100,000
- Ray Tracing: rays/sec ÷ 10,000,000
- Compression: throughput ÷ 10,000,000
- Monte Carlo π: samples/sec ÷ 10,000,000
- JSON Parsing: elements/sec ÷ 10,000,000
- N-Queens: solutions/sec × 10.0

### Normalization Explanation

The normalization process serves several purposes:

1. **Scale Balancing**: Different benchmarks produce vastly different scales of operations per second. Normalization ensures that no single test dominates the overall score.

2. **Weighted Importance**: The system applies 35% weight to single-core performance and 65% to multi-core performance, reflecting the modern computing landscape where multi-threading is increasingly important.

3. **Cross-Platform Comparison**: Normalization allows for fair comparison between different CPU architectures and performance levels.

4. **Target Score Range**: The final normalization factor (0.00178) adjusts the score to a readable range, with typical modern CPUs scoring around 10,000 points.

### CPU Category Weight in Global Scoring

CPU benchmarks contribute 35% to the overall system benchmark score:
- Integer Operations: 12% of total score
- Floating Point Operations: 10% of total score
- Multi-threading: 8% of total score
- Memory Interface: 5% of total score
